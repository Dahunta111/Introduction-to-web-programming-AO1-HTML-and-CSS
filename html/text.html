                <h3>Our idea </h3>
                <P><strong>Jason fray</strong> had an idea to create where we could be all equal. He wasn't alone, he had a lot of support from friends and family. This idea developed into a concept and this concept was to improve the chances of animal life that has been affected by negatively by human interaction. Jason Fray and his friends then started putting money to the side for their first project in 2008, which was to help abandoned exotic animals.  </P>

                <h2>The community was positive </h2>
                <h3>He decided to expand his idea.</h3>
               <p>After a positive response he decided to take his idea to the next level. Firstly he registered properly as a charity called animal rescue  and quickly came up with an idea to get the community more involved whether it was through donations or directly helping.</p>

                <h2>The money  flowed in.</h2>
                <h3>However, it was not enough.</h3>
                <p>
The money wasn’t enough to be a standalone charity to make the impact he wanted. Therefore he got in contact with other charity that does the same line of work around the world and offered support through volunteers and charity, especially to the one that protect endangered animals.
